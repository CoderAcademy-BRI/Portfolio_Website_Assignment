          <hr>
          <p>I truly, genuinely love audio, and it will always define the path of interest to me.  I believe wholeheartedly in the power and influence of audio, and in an accessible world, I love the idea of providing currently disabled yet entirely creative minds with the ability to express, and participate.  </p>
          <p>And that's where my story began, trying to make a musician out of myself and to defy the odds of the people who had held me down.  Not a great first impression to you, I know, and I'm sorry for that, but it lends very significantly to the road I find myself on now.</p> 
          <p>Since then, I've tried and failed at my own musical pursuits, not in a way that I look back on in a negative manner, but rather one of progress and discovery.  I attended a university course for Music Technology in my pursuit to become a professional studio engineer, and in trying to force myself to travel several hours a day and spend a good amount of money in the process on travel costs for a course that ultimately wouldn't satisfy me creatively, I somehow missed how beautifully freeing and fantastically upfront technology is as an industry.</p>
          <p>As a result, when I unenrolled from that course, I found myself <em>INCREDIBLY</em> lost and terribly unsure of what to do.  My friends and family told me something that had been told to me all my life, and for once I actually listened to it:</p>

          <p>"There's lots of money and growth in learning a trade, become a tradie!"</p>

          <p>So, I actually listened to them.  I started really thinking about what it was that I wanted to do, and for once it hit me, electronics and the way it interacts with us as human beings is fascinating.  From there, becoming an electrician wasn't a big jump, so I looked around at government funded electrician certification courses.  I completed one, during which time I performed 100 hours of work experience alongside an incredibly brash and impatient British man named Paul.  It didn't take me long to figure out that this wasn't an industry for anyone looking to do anything genuinely creative, so that alone was enough to deter me from the course, but more importantly, during my time completing the course, I had discovered something about my physiology that was very contradictory with becoming an electrician.  Or a pilot, my childhood dream.</p>
          <p>I found out doing a colourblind test for fun that, huh, I'm actually colourblind.  Very, very badly colourblind.  I mean, I can see colour, but definitely well past being appropriate for an electrician.  So, I after I finished my course, I scratched it off the list, and was back to square one.  Hospitality, failed trades, musical pursuits, and poor grades, despite high potential.  It was a really low point, and I'd say it's the worst I've been in my entire life.</p>
